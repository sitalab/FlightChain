# FlightChain

Flight Chain is one of the reference dApp deployments being put onto the SITA Aviation Blockchain Sandbox. 
It aggregrates flight data from multiple sources and creates a single version of the truth for flight status information 
on a private permissioned blockchain.

This project has now moved to gitlab: https://gitlab.com/FlightChain2/_READMEFIRST 

This repository will no longer be maintained.
